I started moving the Humdrum UI library to a Svelte implementation [Garth/humdrum-svelte](https://github.com/GarthDB/humdrum-svelte), but I don't think it's going to work long term. I have it importing the [Humdrum UI](https://github.com/GarthDB/humdrum-ui) CSS, but it's cumbersome to juggling them at the same time.

I'm putting all this work together because I want to use this UI library as an example of how to start a design system.
