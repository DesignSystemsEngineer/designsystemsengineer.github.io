## Dimension 1: Planning The Course (25 points)


### ✅ Synthesize and Prioritize

Source: [https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-9](https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-9)

Reviewing the blog, I found several weeks where I was focused on researching. Whether it was the tech stack, teaching techniques, or interviews with experts and potential students. But it was week 9 that I hunkered down to really decide what I was going to teach and how I was going to order it. The topic mapping activity, and the discussions I had with Jen and Eric, acted as a lens to focus all of the potential things I could do and get to the heart of what was most useful.


### ✅ conceptional proofs of concept

*   [Humdrum monorepo](https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-5)
*   [Design system overview](https://youtu.be/og2J511ddyk) (video)

I made a few conceptual proofs of concept for the final product, but the final video really shows how it’s matured to its current state. It’s a living thing that I won’t ever feel is completely “finished”.

### ✅ story mapping

Source: [https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-9](https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-9)

As mentioned above, I worked on my story map in week 9, but I kept working on it and still have it on my wall.

### ✅ interview 3-5 engineers

Source: [https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-12](https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-12)

I didn’t post names or companies on my blog since it is technically public and I didn’t get approval. I spoke with Mark Rondina, Senior UX Lead at GE; Jeremy Saenz, Chief Product Officer at Kajabi; Nate Baldwin, Senior Experience Designer at Adobe; Aaron Brownlee, Engineering Manager at Adobe; Mathieu Badimon, Design Manager at Adobe; Demian Borba, Product Manager on Adobe Xd; Connor Hugh, a Web Design student at BYU-I; Dillan Titus, a Marketing student at BYU-I; Romina Painter, a recent graduate from BYU-I and web developer.

### ✅ iterative agile method

*   [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dsengineer/tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dsengineer/tokens)

I released several versions of the design system that were each functional, though less complete than the next version. (click the versions tab).

### ✅ created a usable design system with MVP

Sources:

*   [https://codepen.io/GarthDB/pen/jOrXyWW](https://codepen.io/GarthDB/pen/jOrXyWW)

Starting with the simplest place, I found a way to show how to accomplish the task without unnecessary complication. Instead of building a complete system, I used CodePen that I could get started within minutes.


## Dimension 2: The Course Website (25 Points)

### ✅ Marketing Format

Source: [https://designsystems.engineer/](https://designsystems.engineer/)

I included some starting marketing content on the main page, but it really the introduction is a better starting place.


### ✅ Introduction

Source: [https://designsystems.engineer/courses/fundamentals-of-design-system-engineering](https://designsystems.engineer/courses/fundamentals-of-design-system-engineering)

The initial unit of the course is the introduction.


### ⬜ Log-in

Source: [https://designsystems.engineer/](https://designsystems.engineer/)

I went through a couple of authentication ideas, but after consulting with Egghead, decided to focus on other things. I have faked it with a login link on the homepage, modeled after the auth link on other Egghead large course sites.


### ✅ transcripts

Source: [https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css/](https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css/)

I found Descript to be very helpful in creating transcriptions, but I would often use the script I wrote ahead of time.


### ✅ Course Video

Source: [https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css/](https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css/)

I will move to another video hosting platform, but for now, I’m using unlisted YouTube videos.


## Dimension 3: Course “Design Systems Engineer” Content (50 points)


### ✅ built for engineers to follow

Sources:

*   [https://github.com/DesignSystemsEngineer/coursefiles](https://github.com/DesignSystemsEngineer/coursefiles)
*   [https://codepen.io/GarthDB/pen/jOrXyWW](https://codepen.io/GarthDB/pen/jOrXyWW)

I use GitHub (tags, branches, releases) and embedded CodePens to help the students follow along.


### ✅ apply their knowledge

Source: [https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css-activity/](https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css-activity/)

I use activities to let students apply what they have learned, and then follow up in the next video.


### ✅ The students will gain experience in building, testing, and maintaining a design

Source: [https://designsystems.engineer/courses](https://designsystems.engineer/courses)

It’s really the whole website and course.


## Dimension 4: Design System (50 points)

✅
Sources:

*   [Design system overview](https://youtu.be/og2J511ddyk) (video)
*   [GitHub repo for the design system](https://github.com/DesignSystemsEngineer/designsystem)
*   [Storybook](https://designsystems.engineer/designsystem/?path=/docs/button--default)

The video does the best job detailing the design system, how it works, and how it meets the requirements.


## Dimension 5: Course Production (15 points)

✅
Source: [https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-10](https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-10)

This really deals with the quality of the video and audio of the course. I spent a lot of time and money investing in tools and tweaking them to improve my content. I didn’t talk about it too much in my blog, because it is a second priority, but spent time with a friend who consults with content creators on zoom to discuss my lighting, audio, and video setup.


## Dimension 6: Assessments (15 points)

✅
Source: [https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css-activity/](https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css-activity/)

Initially, I thought I would make some grand open-ended quests for the users to embark on to apply the concepts they learned in a unit, but after discussions with Jen I decided smaller, focused assignments were a better fit. I created starting CodePens and give the students enough freedom to try new things without following along directly.

# Self Assesment

I didn't accomplish as much as I initially intended. The course website isn't really ready for public consumption. I didn't implement an authenticaion solution.

I do think I met the requirements of the rubric and I would give myself a 175/180.
