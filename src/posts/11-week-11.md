Recording and editing isn't too bad when I've got some momentum. That came this week when I recorded and edited my first videos. I used [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) to record, edit, and transcribe the text.

I wrote most of the script out with [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and created the code samples in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).

I found they have an [educational discount](https://help.descript.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042210552-Do-you-offer-non-profit-educational-pricing-plans-) which makes it all the better for this assignment.
