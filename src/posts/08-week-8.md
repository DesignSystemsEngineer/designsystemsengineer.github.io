# Rubric

The Design Systems Engineer course foundation facilitates learning for new to experienced front-end engineers to build their own design system from scratch utilizing my vast experience, resources, and expertise.

## Dimension 1: Planning The Course

### Description

The planning process required ongoing activities to synthesize and prioritize potential topics for this foundational course while facilitating a platform for additional in-depth units in the future. Used conceptional proofs of concepts followed by rapid prototyping to break down broader topics into separate units and sections. Utilized story mapping to prioritize the initial top-level units and card sorting activity to balance and divide each unit into easily digestible sections. Interviewed 3 to 5 experienced design systems engineers on best practices and strategies for the course organization and objectives and applied their feedback to the Design Systems Engineer course's planning in an iterative manner with follow-ups as needed. The iterative agile method used for: scriptwriting, assessments, building unique code for individual sections, creating final code for particular sections, screen recording creating code, recording audio, post-production editing code, and video together, and splitting or combining sections as appropriate for most effective learning. The units are organized in such a way that at the end of each unit, the students have created a usable design system following a minimum viable product (MVP) strategy; each subsequent unit took the existing viable product and augmented it with additional features.

### Needs Work

The planning process demonstrated a lack of ongoing activities to synthesize and prioritize potential topics for this foundational course. No future plans were included. The conceptional proofs of concepts followed by rapid prototyping to break down broader topics into separate units and sections lack organization. The story mapping lacks sequencing and prioritization. The card sorting activity was confusing, and difficult to divide each unit into sections. The interviews lacked substance and content related to the course material.  No evidence of an iterative agile method was used. The unit designs were confusing for students attempting to create a usable design system.

## Dimension 2: The Course Website

### Needs Work

The website demonstrated a needs work level: attempted to host the marketing and introduction to the course content, unclear course expectations, login, minimal video transcripts, and mediocre Design System Course videos.

## Dimension 3: Course “Design Systems Engineer” Content

### Description

The Design Systems Engineer course content is built for engineers to follow along with instructor lead video content and then apply their knowledge of the design system building process to meet their businesses or clients' needs. The students will gain experience in building, testing, and maintaining a design system in a structured and predictable fashion throughout the course. At the end of each unit, a constructivist activity was provided to allow the learners to apply knowledge obtained while following along with the instructor lead videos and apply it to their individual design system engineering goals.

### Needs Work

The Course “Design Systems Engineer” content was difficult for the engineers to follow along during the facilitating and application of knowledge and therefore, building their design system was impossible. Through guided activities at the end of each unit, students had difficulties applying their experience and knowledge to their own design system. Constructivist assessments were incomplete in providing the learners to use the knowledge obtained at the end of each unit.  Additionally, incomplete behaviorist and cognitivist activity set to follow the instructor videos.  This foundational course and website demonstrated the platform is somewhat useful for future expansion into additional foundational topics, but work is needed to refine the product.

## Dimension 4: Design System

### Description

The Design System Engineer course was built to enable individualized application by engineers to their design system. A sample design system was provided for instructional purposes and can be used as an example template for learners' individualized applications. The course utilized this design system to demonstrate practical applications, build upon concepts, solidify understanding, and apply their newly acquired knowledge to their individual design system goals. The CSS was written in a modular fashion to enable use with multiple JavaScript frameworks in the future. Structured design tokens were organized for reuse, scalability, and future maintainability across various platforms and products. A JavaScript implementation was provided to leverage the modular CSS and to enable additional functionality while standardizing interaction design. DevOps best practices were used to organize the design system packages, automate testing, standardize deployment, improve collaboration, and increase stability.
