In April of 2024, I was sitting with Patrick Fulton, my wife Jamie, and Noelle Lansford in the Palladium Theater in St. Petersburg, Florida. We were on a break between sessions at the Front End Design Conf. I think Ben Callahan had just finished, and he was standing chatting with us. I don't really remember exactly what we said; it was a while ago, but I remember the conversation turning to Design System Engineering—specifically, the gap between design resources and engineering resources. I wanted to do something about it.

In 2022, my wife and I were working on our MBA online from Quantic, and for our capstone we put together a proposal for building a course for Design System Engineering and how we could make it something that might be able to make some money, but also get some of the ideas and experience I've had working on Spectrum, Adobe's design system, out of my head and share it with others.

Further back in 2020, I was finishing up a Master's degree, Digital Media Design from Harvard Extension school, and I was using my capstone project as an excuse to apply the andragogy skills I had been sharpening to a Design Systems Engineering course or workshop that I could use to teach front-end engineers how to build a design system from scratch.

All the way back in 2016, I was working as a front-end design engineer on PhoneGap at Adobe. I was working with some really smart developers, and we were kicking around the idea of building a default web ui kit for new PhoneGap developers to use as a starting point for building new apps. I wanted it to leverage Adobe's strong design branding, and someone mentioned I should chat with Mathieu Badimon, who was working on ideas from the design side. This eventually led to me working full-time on Spectrum, Adobe's Design System, and returning to the Adobe Design Team.

Last stop on the time machine tour: in 2011, I was interviewed and hired by Ethan Eismann as a Senior Experience Designer to work on the default styling for Adobe Flex 4. It was my first experience building what I would later consider to be a design system. It was intended to be a generic starting set of components for designers and engineers building applications with Flex 4's new Spark architecture. Spark used Flex 4's new skinning engine, which allowed for full decoupling of logic from styling and appearance. It was a super fun, strongly typed architecture, and I loved being a Designer working on developer tools in a framework I knew very well.

Around this time, I was also hosting podcasts in the Adobe MAX community lounge and teaching web design and development classes at UNLV as an adjunct professor.

What I'm trying to get at with all of this is that even though I have some idea of what I want to do with DesignSystems.Engineer, I've been circling this idea for years without committing to it.

Look, I don't know exactly how I'm going to accomplish this. But that's never stopped me before.

When we started Spectrum, it was a conversation between me and Mathieu about a PhoneGap UI kit. When I started teaching at UNLV, I had never taught a class before. When we built the Spark skinning architecture for Flex 4, we were making it up as we went.

What I do know: **there's a real gap in resources for engineers building design systems.** Most content focuses on design decisions and organizational strategy. Critical stuff, but it leaves out the engineering perspective—the architecture, the tradeoffs, the "how do I actually build this" questions.

I'm committed to filling that gap. Resources, frameworks, eventually a course. But I need to know what you actually need, not what I assume you need.

**If you're building a design system**, what keeps you stuck? What questions don't have good answers yet? What would make your work materially easier?

I'm figuring this out as I go, but I'm moving forward. Come build it with me.
