In April of 2024, I was sitting with Patrick Fulton, my wife Jamie, and Noelle Lansford in the Palladium Theater in St. Petersburg, Florida. We were on a break between sessions at the Front End Design Conf. I think Ben Callahan had just finished, and he was standing chatting with us. I don't really remember exactly what we said; it was a while ago, but I do remember wanting to build a Design System Engineering community or resources.

In 2022, my wife and I were working on our MBA online from Quantic, and for our capstone we put together a proposal for building a course for Design System Engineering and how we could make it something that might be able to make some money, but also get some of the ideas and experience I've had working on Spectrum, Adobe's design system, out of my head and share it with other.

Further back in 2020, I was finishing up a Master's degree, Digital Media Design from Harvard Extension school, and I was using my capstone project as an excuse to apply the andragogy skills I had been sharpening to a Design Systems Engineering course or workshop that I could use to teach front-end engineers how to build a design system from scratch.

All the way back in 2016, I was working as a front-end design engineer on PhoneGap at Adobe. I was working with some really smart developers, and we were kicking around the idea of building a default web ui kit for new PhoneGap developers to use as a starting point for building new apps. I wanted it to leverage Adobe's strong design branding, and someone mentioned I should chat with Mathieu Badimon, who was working on ideas from the design side. This eventually led to me working full-time on Spectrum, Adobe's Design System, and returning to the Adobe Design Team.

Last stop on the time machine tour: in 2011, I was interviewed and hired by Ethan Eismann as a Senior Experience Designer to work on the default styling for Adobe Flex 4. It was my first experience building what I would later consider to be a design system. It was intended to be a generic starting set of components for designers and engineers building applications with Flex 4's new Spark architecture. Spark used Flex 4's new skinning engine, which allowed for full decoupling of logic from styling and appearance. It was a super fun, strongly typed architecture, and I loved being a Designer working on developer tools in a framework I knew very well.

Around this time, I was also hosting podcasts in the Adobe MAX community lounge and teaching web design and development classes at UNLV as an adjunct professor.

What I'm trying to get at with all of this is that even though I have some idea of what I want to do with DesignSystems.Engineer, I've been having a hard time figuring out how to get there.

I want to build a collection of resources for engineers and designers who want to code a Design System, either from scratch or by improving an existing one. Eventually, I'd like to turn that into a course on building a design system from start to stable.

There are plenty of smart resources and materials specifically for Designers, but fewer from a coding perspective.

Last week, I published my first article on DesignSystems.Engineer and set out my first newsletter about it. It wasn't much, a bit vague and generic, a decent idea at the center, but I don't know what I'm doing.

If you're interested in helping me out, it would be nice to know what you're looking for. I have some guesses to start with, but I'm mostly taking a stab in the dark.
