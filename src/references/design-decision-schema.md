Use this checklist when documenting a design decision so it’s reusable and auditable.

- **Context** — What problem or question does this decision address?
- **Options considered** — What alternatives did you evaluate (including “do nothing”)?
- **Decision** — What did you choose? State it clearly.
- **Rationale** — Why this option over the others?
- **Constraints** — When does this apply? When does it *not* apply?
- **Outcomes** — How will you know it worked? What might you measure or observe?
- **Ownership** — Who is responsible for revisiting or updating this decision?
- **Links** — Related decisions, components, or docs.

Not every decision needs every field. Use the ones that reduce ambiguity and make the decision easier to find and apply later.
