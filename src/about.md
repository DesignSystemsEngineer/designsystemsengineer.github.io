**Design Systems Engineer** is a writing project about how design decisions actually scale.

Every team makes design decisions. The hard part is making them survive new people, new platforms, redesigns, and automation. That's where most systems break down.

This site focuses on the work behind the work: how design intent gets named, structured, shared, and maintained over time. Design systems are part of that story, but so are tokens, schemas, component APIs, documentation, governance, and release processes.

The emphasis here is practical and structural. Less about tools. More about mechanics.

## What you'll find here

- Essays on design systems as infrastructure, not artifacts
- Frameworks for reasoning about design decisions at scale
- References, checklists, and patterns drawn from real systems
- Notes on designer–engineer collaboration and handoff

The goal is to reduce ambiguity, rework, and fragility-without turning systems into rigid bureaucracy.

## Who this is for

This is written for people working close to the edges of scale:

- design systems and platform engineers
- senior designers operating in technical contexts
- staff/principal ICs navigating long-lived systems
- engineering managers partnering deeply with design

If you care about consistency and adaptability, this work is for you.

## About the author

**Design Systems Engineer** is written by [Garth Braithwaite](https://garthdb.com/), based on hands-on experience building and maintaining design system infrastructure in production environments.

This project exists to turn that experience into reusable thinking-and to make design decisions easier to reason about, change, and trust.
