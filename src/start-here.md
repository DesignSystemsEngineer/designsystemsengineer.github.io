This site is a thought-leadership project about **codifying design decisions**: turning implicit choices into explicit, reusable systems.

**What you'll find here**

- **Writing** — Essays and posts on decision-making, design systems, and codification.
- **Frameworks** — Mental models and scales (e.g. the Codification Ladder) to structure how you think.
- **References** — Checklists, schemas, and templates you can use when documenting decisions.

**How to navigate**

Use the main nav: **Writing**, **Frameworks**, **References**, and **About**. Start with a few posts and one framework to get the vocabulary, then explore references when you're ready to apply them.

**What you'll learn**

Why codification matters, how to talk about it with stakeholders, and practical ways to capture and reuse design decisions in your own work.
