{"html":"<p>Getting into the home stretch, I've been focusing on my presentation.</p>\n<p>The biggest issue I'm running into is the same issue my project as a whole has: explaining what a design system is.</p>\n<p>Most designers and developers can see the benefit of have shared resources like ui kits (i.e. design files: Sketch, Figma, Adobe Xd, etc.), assets (i.e. icons, graphics, photography, branding), and component libraries (i.e. React/Vue/Angular and CSS libraries with code examples), but that doesn't mean they've heard the term design system. Thinking through how to systematically collaborate as a company on these deliverables makes a design system more than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p>I've put together a deck with some explanation of what a design system is and then going into the course I've been creating. It's a short demonstration (15 min) and I have a lot of information.</p>\n<p>As always, it comes down to editing and focusing.</p>\n<p>The last couple of weeks I've also been able to conduct some user interviews with design system experts and potential future students.</p>\n<p>I discussed with the experts what they wish they had known. With the potential students, I discussed pain points and ways they've tried to get into building design system like things. Part of me always assumes I know what I'm going to learn from interviews and so it feels like a less effective use of my time, but I'm always pleasantly surprised that I gain a better sense of empathy for those I'm hoping to help by listening. I never regret interviews when I'm done.</p>\n<p>I've met with 3 people from Adobe that I've worked with, 2 from other companies of different sizes, and web design/dev students 3 students that I have mentored and/or taught at BYU-I.</p>\n","title":"Presentation prep & user interviews","slug":"week-12","summary":"Presentation prep","date":"2020-11-20T00:00:00.000Z"}
