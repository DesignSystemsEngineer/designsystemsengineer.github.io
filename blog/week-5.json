I used <a href=\"https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/\">Style Dictionary</a> as the build and organization tool.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dsengineer/css\">@dsengineer/css</a> takes the tokens from @dsengineer/tokens and applies them to a CSS implementation.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dsengineer/svelte\">@dsengineer/svelte</a> imports the CSS from @dsengineer/css and uses it in a Svelte lib. This also has a <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">Storybook</a> implementation. It is published at <a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/designsystem\">designsystems.engineer/designsystem</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This single unified repository makes it so much easier to build and test the components, css, and tokens.</p>\n","title":"Week 5","slug":"week-5","summary":"A week of research.","date":"2020-10-02T00:00:00.000Z"}
