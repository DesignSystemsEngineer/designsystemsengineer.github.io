{"html":"<p>DGMD E-599\nGarth Braithwaite\nDesign Systems Engineer</p>\n<h2>Dimension 1: Planning The Course (25 points)</h2>\n<h3>✅ Synthesize and Prioritize</h3>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-9\">https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-9</a></p>\n<p>Reviewing the blog, I found several weeks where I was focused on researching. Whether it was the tech stack, teaching techniques, or interviews with experts and potential students. But it was week 9 that I hunkered down to really decide what I was going to teach and how I was going to order it. The topic mapping activity, and the discussions I had with Jen and Eric, acted as a lens to focus all of the potential things I could do and get to the heart of what was most useful.</p>\n<h3>✅ conceptional proofs of concept</h3>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-2\">A week of research</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-3\">Breaking things in Style Dictionary</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-4\">Humdrum Svelte</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-5\">Humdrum monorepo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/og2J511ddyk\">Design system overview</a> (video)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I made a few conceptual proofs of concept for the final product, but the final video really shows how it’s matured to its current state. It’s a living thing that I won’t ever feel is completely “finished”.</p>\n<h3>✅ story mapping</h3>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-9\">https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-9</a></p>\n<p>As mentioned above, I worked on my story map in week 9, but I kept working on it and still have it on my wall.</p>\n<h3>✅ interview 3-5 engineers</h3>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-12\">https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-12</a></p>\n<p>I didn’t post names or companies on my blog since it is technically public and I didn’t get approval. I spoke with Mark Rondina, Senior UX Lead at GE; Jeremy Saenz, Chief Product Officer at Kajabi; Nate Baldwin, Senior Experience Designer at Adobe; Aaron Brownlee, Engineering Manager at Adobe; Mathieu Badimon, Design Manager at Adobe; Demian Borba, Product Manager on Adobe Xd; Connor Hugh, a Web Design student at BYU-I; Dillan Titus, a Marketing student at BYU-I; Romina Painter, a recent graduate from BYU-I and web developer.</p>\n<h3>✅ iterative agile method</h3>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dsengineer/svelte\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dsengineer/svelte</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dsengineer/css\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dsengineer/css</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dsengineer/tokens\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dsengineer/tokens</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I released several versions of the design system that were each functional, though less complete than the next version. (click the versions tab).</p>\n<h3>✅ created a usable design system with MVP</h3>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://codepen.io/GarthDB/pen/jOrXyWW\">https://codepen.io/GarthDB/pen/jOrXyWW</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Starting with the simplest place, I found a way to show how to accomplish the task without unnecessary complication. Instead of building a complete system, I used CodePen that I could get started within minutes.</p>\n<h2>Dimension 2: The Course Website (25 Points)</h2>\n<h3>✅ Marketing Format</h3>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/\">https://designsystems.engineer/</a></p>\n<p>I included some starting marketing content on the main page, but it really the introduction is a better starting place.</p>\n<h3>✅ Introduction</h3>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/courses/fundamentals-of-design-system-engineering\">https://designsystems.engineer/courses/fundamentals-of-design-system-engineering</a></p>\n<p>The initial unit of the course is the introduction.</p>\n<h3>⬜ Log-in</h3>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/\">https://designsystems.engineer/</a></p>\n<p>I went through a couple of authentication ideas, but after consulting with Egghead, decided to focus on other things. I have faked it with a login link on the homepage, modeled after the auth link on other Egghead large course sites.</p>\n<h3>✅ transcripts</h3>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css/\">https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css/</a></p>\n<p>I found Descript to be very helpful in creating transcriptions, but I would often use the script I wrote ahead of time.</p>\n<h3>✅ Course Video</h3>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css/\">https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css/</a></p>\n<p>I will move to another video hosting platform, but for now, I’m using unlisted YouTube videos.</p>\n<h2>Dimension 3: Course “Design Systems Engineer” Content (50 points)</h2>\n<h3>✅ built for engineers to follow</h3>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/DesignSystemsEngineer/coursefiles\">https://github.com/DesignSystemsEngineer/coursefiles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://codepen.io/GarthDB/pen/jOrXyWW\">https://codepen.io/GarthDB/pen/jOrXyWW</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I use GitHub (tags, branches, releases) and embedded CodePens to help the students follow along.</p>\n<h3>✅ apply their knowledge</h3>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css-activity/\">https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css-activity/</a></p>\n<p>I use activities to let students apply what they have learned, and then follow up in the next video.</p>\n<h3>✅ The students will gain experience in building, testing, and maintaining a design</h3>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/courses\">https://designsystems.engineer/courses</a></p>\n<p>It’s really the whole website and course.</p>\n<h2>Dimension 4: Design System (50 points)</h2>\n<p>✅\nSources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/og2J511ddyk\">Design system overview</a> (video)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/DesignSystemsEngineer/designsystem\">GitHub repo for the design system</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/designsystem/?path=/docs/button--default\">Storybook</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The video does the best job detailing the design system, how it works, and how it meets the requirements.</p>\n<h2>Dimension 5: Course Production (15 points)</h2>\n<p>✅\nSource: <a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-10\">https://designsystems.engineer/blog/week-10</a></p>\n<p>This really deals with the quality of the video and audio of the course. I spent a lot of time and money investing in tools and tweaking them to improve my content. I didn’t talk about it too much in my blog, because it is a second priority, but spent time with a friend who consults with content creators on zoom to discuss my lighting, audio, and video setup.</p>\n<h2>Dimension 6: Assessments (15 points)</h2>\n<p>✅\nSource: <a href=\"https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css-activity/\">https://designsystems.engineer/lessons/dse-button-css-activity/</a></p>\n<p>Initially, I thought I would make some grand open-ended quests for the users to embark on to apply the concepts they learned in a unit, but after discussions with Jen I decided smaller, focused assignments were a better fit. I created starting CodePens and give the students enough freedom to try new things without following along directly.</p>\n<h1>Self Assesment</h1>\n<p>I didn't accomplish as much as I initially intended. The course website isn't really ready for public consumption. I didn't implement an authenticaion solution.</p>\n<p>I do think I met the requirements of the rubric and I would give myself a 175/180.</p>\n","title":"Assignment 5: Capstone project","slug":"capstone-project","summary":"Capstone project","date":"2020-12-19T00:00:00.000Z"}
