{"html":"<h2>Backstory</h2>\n<p>As of writing this, I'm about to start the last semester (knock on wood) in my master's program in Digital Media Design from the <a href=\"https://www.extension.harvard.edu/\">Harvard Extension School</a>. This semester, I am just taking DGMD E-599 Digital Media Capstone Design Studio, an advisement course focused on completing my capstone project. In preparation for this course, I spent the summer writing my capstone proposal with the support of my advisor, Dr. Hongming Wang.</p>\n<p>This blog's primary intention is to catalog the progress I make in creating my capstone project and the changes I make to my proposed plan along the way.</p>\n<p>You can read my final capstone proposal <a href=\"/capstone-proposal.pdf\">here (capstone-proposal.pdf)</a>.</p>\n<h2>Work created in preparation for my capstone project.</h2>\n<p>Most of my preparation work prior to starting DGMD E-599 is research and skill building that I've detailed in my proposal. I've done some minor ideation around branding and the general ideas of this project, but nothing formalized.</p>\n","title":"Capstone Proposal","slug":"capstone-proposal","summary":"A short post about ...","date":"2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z"}
