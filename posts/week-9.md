This week, I took the advice of Jen and Eric (my capstone and advisors) to follow Alec's example (a classmate) to use sticky notes and map out course topics, then organize them. The primary objective, for me, is to keep track of topic ideas and manage them for the initial capstone offering and things that would be out of scope now but that I want to keep track of for future updates. Mostly it will help me stay focused.

I included an image below, but I'm expecting it to be a bit of a living activity as I continue to work on the course.

The sticky notes' color relates to the different times I added items; each time, I used a new color.

The top section notes are prerequisites. Things the students will need to have previous experience with if they want to follow. The main middle area is the capstone topic items. The section to the right is out of scope topics.
