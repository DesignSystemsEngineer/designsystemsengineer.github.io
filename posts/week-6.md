I spent some time polishing up the design system monorepo and worked on a strategy for the order of teaching the material. I'm planning on getting the participants to have visual wins as quickly and regularly as possible which is a good way to build a minimum viable product. ![Illustration of a minimum viable product process](/mvp.jpg)

I also met with Jen this week and got some good feedback on how to approach the course work and to keep the material focused for the capstone requirements, but potential broader for post capstone work.
