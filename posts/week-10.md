This week I'm playing catchup after recovering from having surgery to remove hardware from my ankle.

I finished setting up my studio and wrote my first scripts. I've started to record tonight after talking to Jen, my advisor.

I'm a bit behind where I'd want to be, but I'm confident I'll be done in time.

I'm also looking into better assessments after talking with my advisor; she gave me some great ideas I'll be trying out this week.

Here's a photo of my studio setup and my video checkin.
