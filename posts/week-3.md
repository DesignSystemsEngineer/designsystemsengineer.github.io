I have started the Style Dictionary work I mentioned last week with the Hum Drum UI kit tokens.

I've setup my form, but found it wasn't a trivial thing to add it to my Svelte based website.

I also setup appointments with my advisor and another appointment to meet with a few class peers that my professor recommended.

It didn't feel like a very productive week so I'll be putting in more time over the weekend.
