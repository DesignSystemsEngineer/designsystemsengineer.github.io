## Backstory

As of writing this, I'm about to start the last semester (knock on wood) in my master's program in Digital Media Design from the [Harvard Extension School](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/). This semester, I am just taking DGMD E-599 Digital Media Capstone Design Studio, an advisement course focused on completing my capstone project. In preparation for this course, I spent the summer writing my capstone proposal with the support of my advisor, Dr. Hongming Wang.

This blog's primary intention is to catalog the progress I make in creating my capstone project and the changes I make to my proposed plan along the way.

You can read my final capstone proposal [here (capstone-proposal.pdf)](/capstone-proposal.pdf).

## Work created in preparation for my capstone project.

Most of my preparation work prior to starting DGMD E-599 is research and skill building that I've detailed in my proposal. I've done some minor ideation around branding and the general ideas of this project, but nothing formalized.
