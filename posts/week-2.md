For my capstone project, the most significant progress was made in a meeting with my advisor today.

I've decided I need to limit my scope regarding the design system I'm creating for the course and the course itself. There are so many topics I'd like to cover that I'm not going to be able to do it all in this semester.

As far as the site itself, I've fixed my ConverKit account and can add the signup form. Also, I've started working on the design system using [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/). I will repurpose the existing design system I made for a previous class, called [Humdrum UI](https://github.com/GarthDB/humdrum-ui), as a way to get started quicker.
