I've set you up a code pen to get you started. You can fork it and save it to your own account if you want to save your progress. But let me show you what we have. You can see that we have our button that we styled, like we did our last one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd if we look, we can see in our CSS that we've actually linked the external style sheet, I've linked the previous code pen. So it brings in all that styling that we just did. And what we want to do. If we look at our S sticker sheet, as we want to create a button that. Has a slightly lighter blue.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen our hover, but other than that, the States are fairly similar. So it's slightly lighter blue so that we still have high enough contrast when we go from the default state to the hover state and the downstate or the active state. And, keeping all that contrast, means that you'd be able to tell the differences between the States.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut we also want to keep some contrast between the call to action button and the primary button. These want to be different enough that if they were sitting next to each other, That you draw more attention, hopefully to the call to action button. So if we look at our button here. I don't want you just to use the same class.
